# 🧬 Cell State Prediction in Disease Progression

## 📖 Project Overview
Single-cell RNA sequencing (**scRNA-seq**) has transformed our understanding of cellular behavior in diseases such as **cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory diseases**. This project leverages **transformer-based models (scGPT, scVI)** to predict **cell state transitions** during disease progression.

🔍 **Key Features**:
- ✅ **Preprocess** and normalize scRNA-seq data.
- ✅ **Train transformer-based models** (scGPT, scVI) to predict cell states.
- ✅ **Compare predictions** with traditional methods (Monocle3, PAGA).
- ✅ **Deploy an interactive web application** for visualization.
